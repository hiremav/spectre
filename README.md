# Spectre

**Spectre** is a Ruby gem that makes it easy to AI-enable your Ruby on Rails application. Currently, Spectre focuses on helping developers perform vector-based searches, generate embeddings, and manage multiple dynamic prompts â€” ideal for applications that require RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and dynamic prompts.

## Compatibility

| Feature                | Compatibility |
|------------------------|---------------|
| Foundation Model (LLM) | OpenAI        |
| Embeddings             | OpenAI        |
| Vector Searching       | MongoDB Atlas |
| Prompt Files           | OpenAI        |


**ðŸ’¡ Note:** We'll first be prioritizing additional foundation models (Claude, Cohere, LLaMA, etc), then looking to add additional support for more vector database (Pgvector, Pinecone, etc). If you're looking for something a bit more extendable we highly recommend checking out [langchainrb](https://github.com/patterns-ai-core/langchainrb).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spectre'
```
And then execute:
```bash
bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
gem install spectre
```
## Usage

### 1. Setup

First, youâ€™ll need to generate the initializer to configure your OpenAI API key. Run the following command to create the initializer:
```bash
rails generate spectre:install
```
This will create a file at config/initializers/spectre.rb, where you can set your OpenAI API key:
```ruby
Spectre.setup do |config|
  config.api_key = 'your_openai_api_key'
  config.llm_provider = :openai
end
```
### 2. Integrate Spectre with Your Rails Model

**2.1. Embeddable Module**

To use Spectre for generating embeddings in your Rails model, follow these steps:

1.	Include the Spectre module.
2.	Declare the Model as embeddable.
3.	Define the embeddable fields.

Here is an example of how to set this up in a model:
```ruby
class Model
  include Mongoid::Document
  include Spectre

  spectre :embeddable
  embeddable_field :message, :response, :category
end
```

**2.2. Searchable Module (MongoDB Only)**

**Note:** The `Searchable` module is designed to work exclusively with Mongoid models. If you attempt to include it in a non-Mongoid model, an error will be raised. This ensures that vector-based searches, which rely on MongoDB's specific features, are only used in appropriate contexts.

To enable vector-based search in your Rails model:

1.	Include the Spectre module.
2.	Declare the Model as Searchable.
3.	Configure search paramaters.

Use the following methods to configure the search path, index, and result fields:
- **configure_spectre_search_path:** The path where the embeddings are stored.
- **configure_spectre_search_index:** The index used for the vector search.
- **configure_spectre_result_fields:** The fields to include in the search results.

Here is an example of how to set this up in a model:

```ruby
class Model
  include Mongoid::Document
  include Spectre

  spectre :searchable
  configure_spectre_search_path 'embedding'
  configure_spectre_search_index 'vector_index'
  configure_spectre_result_fields({ "message": 1, "response": 1 })
end
```

### 3. Generating Embeddings

**Generate Embedding for a Single Record**

To generate an embedding for a single record, you can call the embed! method on the instance record:
```ruby
record = Model.find(some_id)
record.embed!
```
This will generate the embedding and store it in the specified embedding field, along with the timestamp in the embedded_at field.

**Generate Embeddings for Multiple Records**

To generate embeddings for multiple records at once, use the embed_all! method:
```ruby
Model.embed_all!(
  scope: -> { where(:response.exists => true, :response.ne => nil) },
  validation: ->(record) { !record.response.blank? }
)
```
This method will generate embeddings for all records that match the given scope and validation criteria. The method will also print the number of successful and failed embeddings to the console.

**Directly Generate Embeddings Using Spectre.provider_module::Embeddings.generate**

If you need to generate an embedding directly without using the model integration, you can use the `Spectre.provider_module::Embeddings.generate` method. This can be useful if you want to generate embeddings for custom text outside of your models. For example, with OpenAI:

```ruby
Spectre::provider_module::Embeddings.generate("Your text here")
```

This method sends the text to OpenAIâ€™s API and returns the embedding vector. You can optionally specify a different model by passing it as an argument:

```ruby
Spectre.provider_module::Embeddings.generate("Your text here", model: "text-embedding-3-large")
```

### 4. Performing Vector-Based Searches

Once your model is configured as searchable, you can perform vector-based searches on the stored embeddings:

```ruby
Model.vector_search('Your search query', custom_result_fields: { "response" => 1 }, additional_scopes: [{ "$match": { "category": "science" } }])
```

This method will:

â€¢	Embed the search query using the configured LLM provider.

â€¢	Perform a vector-based search on the embeddings stored in the specified search_path.

â€¢	Return the matching records with the specified result_fields and their vectorSearchScore.

**Examples:**

â€¢	**Custom Result Fields**: Limit the fields returned in the search results.

â€¢	**Additional Scopes**: Apply additional MongoDB filters to the search results.

### 5. Generating Completions

Spectre provides an interface to generate text completions using your configured LLM provider, allowing you to generate dynamic responses, messages, or other forms of text.

**Basic Completion Example**

To generate a simple text completion, use the Spectre.provider_module::Completions.generate method. You can provide a user prompt and an optional system prompt to guide the response:
    
```ruby
Spectre.provider_module::Completions.generate(
  user_prompt: "Tell me a joke.",
  system_prompt: "You are a funny assistant."
)
```

This sends the request to the LLM providerâ€™s API and returns the generated completion.

**Customizing the Completion**

You can customize the behavior by specifying additional parameters such as the model or an assistant_prompt to provide further context for the AIâ€™s responses:

```ruby
Spectre.provider_module::Completions.generate(
  user_prompt: "Tell me a joke.",
  system_prompt: "You are a funny assistant.",
  assistant_prompt: "Sure, here's a joke!",
  model: "gpt-4-turbo"
)
```

**Using a JSON Schema for Structured Output**

For cases where you need structured output (e.g., for returning specific fields or formatted responses), you can pass a json_schema parameter. The schema ensures that the completion conforms to a predefined structure:

```ruby
json_schema = {
  name: "completion_response",
  schema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      response: { type: "string" },
      final_answer: { type: "string" }
    },
    required: ["response", "final_answer"],
    additionalProperties: false
  }
}

Spectre.provider_module::Completions.generate(
  user_prompt: "What is the capital of France?",
  system_prompt: "You are a knowledgeable assistant.",
  json_schema: json_schema
)
```
This structured format guarantees that the response adheres to the schema youâ€™ve provided, ensuring more predictable and controlled results.

### 6. Generating Dynamic Prompts

Spectre provides a system for generating dynamic prompts based on templates. You can define reusable prompt templates and generate them with different inputs in your Rails app.

**Example Directory Structure for Prompts**

Create a folder structure in your app to hold the prompt templates:

```
app/spectre/prompts/
â””â”€â”€ rag/
    â”œâ”€â”€ system_prompt.yml.erb
    â””â”€â”€ user_prompt.yml.erb
```

Each .yml.erb file can contain dynamic content and be customized with embedded Ruby (ERB).

**Example Prompt Templates**

â€¢	system_prompt.yml.erb:
```yaml
system: |
  You are a helpful assistant designed to provide answers based on specific documents and context provided to you.
  Follow these guidelines:
  1. Only provide answers based on the context provided.
  2. Be polite and concise.
```

â€¢	user_prompt.yml.erb:
```yaml
user: |
  User's query: <%= @query %>
  Context: <%= @objects.join(", ") %>
```

**Generating Prompts in Your Code**

You can generate prompts in your Rails application using the Spectre::Prompt.generate method, which loads and renders the specified prompt template:

```ruby
# Generate a system prompt
Spectre::Prompt.generate(type: 'rag', prompt: :system)

# Generate a user prompt with local variables
Spectre::Prompt.generate(
  type: 'rag',
  prompt: :user,
  locals: {
    query: query,
    objects: objects
  }
)
```

â€¢	name: The name of the folder where the prompt files are stored (e.g., rag).
â€¢	prompt: The name of the specific prompt file (e.g., system or user).
â€¢	locals: A hash of variables to be used inside the ERB template.

**Generating Example Prompt Files**

You can use a Rails generator to create example prompt files in your project. Run the following command:

```bash
rails generate spectre:install
```
